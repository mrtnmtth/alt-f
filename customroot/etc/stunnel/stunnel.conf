; Sample stunnel configuration file for Unix by Michal Trojnara 2002-2011
; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please read the manual and make sure you understand them

; * Global Options                                                            *

; foreground = yes

; A copy of some devices and system files is needed within the chroot jail
; Chroot conflicts with configuration file reload and many other features
; chroot = /usr/var/lib/stunnel/
; Chroot jail can be escaped if setuid option is not used
; setuid = nobody
; setgid = nobody

; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /var/run/stunnel.pid

; Debugging stuff (may useful for troubleshooting)
; emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5), info (6), or debug (7)
debug = 4
output = /var/log/stunnel.log
syslog = no

; *****************************************************************************
; * Service Defaults (may also be specified in individual service sections)   *

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
;key = /usr/etc/stunnel/mail.pem

; Authentication stuff needs to be configured to prevent MITM attacks
; It is not enabled by default!
; verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/ssl/cert.pem
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively CRLfile can be used
;CRLfile = /etc/ssl/cert.pem

; Enable support for insecure SSLv3 protocol
;options = -NO_SSLv3
; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; The following options provide additional security at some performance penalty
; Default ECDH/DH parameters are strong/conservative, so it is quite safe to
; comment out these lines in order to get a performance boost
; options = SINGLE_ECDH_USE
; options = SINGLE_DH_USE

; Example SSL server mode services

; [pop3s]
; accept  = 995
; connect = 110

; [imaps]
; accept  = 993
; connect = 143

; [ssmtp]
; accept  = 465
; connect = 25

; Example SSL client mode services

;[gmail-pop3]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:110
;connect = pop.gmail.com:995

;[gmail-imap]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:143
;connect = imap.gmail.com:993

;[gmail-smtp]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:25
;connect = smtp.gmail.com:465

; Alt-F WARNING
;
; https and secure swat is provided by Alt-F through inetd configured stunnel,
; which is slower than running stunnel as a server but is more memory efficient.
; the http web Setup Page handle both case

; SSL front-end to administrative web server
[https]
accept = 443
connect = 127.0.0.1:80
;TIMEOUTclose = 0

; Secure SWAT, accept SSL connections on port 902 and tunnel it to port 901 for swat. 
[swat]
accept   = 902
connect  = 127.0.0.1:901
;TIMEOUTclose = 0
